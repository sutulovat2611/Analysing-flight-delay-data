# Data processing for Big Data - Analysing Flight-delays Data
## Background
The flight-delays prediction dataset has become one popular dataset used by the aviation industry to predict the delay given the historical flight data. Learning from data can be beneficial for the companies, e.g. aviation industry, so that they can minimize the delay to improve customer satisfaction. The insight of the data can be obtained by conducting some steps, including pre-processing, visualization, and data modelling. In this project, we use Spark to visualize, and manipulate historical flight-delays data using Spark RDD and Spark SQL.

## Information on Dataset
The flight-delays and cancellation data was collected and published by the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This data records the flights operated by large air carriers and tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights. This data
summarises various flight information such as the number of on-time, delayed, cancelled, and diverted flights published in DOT's monthly in 2015.
* A folder 'flights' containing 20 _flight*.csv_ files
* _airports.csv_

## Tasks
### Assignment 1:
* **Part 1:** Work with RDDs in PySpark to implement specific queries related to flight delays data analysis.
* **Part 2:** Work with Dataframes in PySpark to implement specific queries related to flight delays data analysis.
* **Part 3:** Implement a query and compare three different approaches: RDD, DataFrame, and SparkSQL.
